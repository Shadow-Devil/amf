     Welcome to the _Zencoder API_ Documentation. The _Zencoder API_
     allows you to connect your application to our encoding service
     and encode videos without going through the web  interface. You
     may also benefit from one of our
     [integration libraries](https://app.zencoder.com/docs/faq/basics/libraries)
     for different languages.
